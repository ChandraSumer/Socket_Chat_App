Make a client server text chat application. Multiple users should be able to chat concurrently. No need to have multiple groups. Just one big chat room



This will give you experience in coding tcp IP internals.



Read up about Socket Programming as well as multithreading using unix fork command



Try out Netcat... it's a old command line tool written in C that works both as the client as well as server. Only thing is netcat when in server mode can accept only one client for say chatting



One client at a time I mean.



Your server should support multiple clients.



Will give you good exposure to multithreading if you use pthread_create() instead of fork() at server side to accept multiple clients. Fork() creates new child processes to accept more clients



Pthread creates new threads to do the same.



So in sum... you will learn processes, threads and networking.



If you want to go a step further.... handle client requests asynchronously using "event handlers" at server side. Its a vitally important CS core concept.
